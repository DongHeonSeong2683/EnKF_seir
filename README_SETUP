This README file explains how to set up and configure your simulations.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make a directory where you will run the code.

Initially you only need the file 
    infile.in
copy it from the run catalogue and run
    seir
This command will then run an ensemble prediction without any data assimilation
and a number of files are generated:


MEASUREMENTS OF DEATHS AND HOSPITALIZED:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The observations are stored in the file corona.in. See example file for Norway in the run directory.
The file contains the following columns:
dd/mm-yyyy     "Accumulated number of deaths"   "current number of hospitalized"  "Accumulated number of cases"
The last column in currently not used.
A negative or zero data value will not be used.


POPULATION:
~~~~~~~~~~
Norwegian population numbers are hard coded and output to two template files.
   population.template  : two columns with population of males and females for each age (0-100++)
   agegroups.template   : total population for each agegroup
You should edit either one of these with your numbers and save the chosen file to either
   population.in or agegroups.in


FRACTION OF MILD, SEVERE, and FATALLY ILL PER AGE GROUP:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The file
   pfactors.in          
is generated with some default values, which can be edited and changed.


R-REPRODUCTION IN BETWEEN AGE GROUPS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The model contains 11 age-groups and allows for using different R numbers between different age groups.
Currently, three matrices are generated all with the number 1.00 for all transsmission. These can later be
edited to represent different scenarios.
   Rmatrix_01.in
   Rmatrix_02.in
   Rmatrix_03.in
The actual R-numbers is R = p%R(k) * Rmatrix_k  where P%R(k) comes from the infile.in



OUTPUT FILES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
susc_0.dat   susc_1.dat   : Prior and posterior susceptability (accumualted)
recov_0.dat  recov_1.dat  : Prior and posterior recovered (accumualted)
case_0.dat   case_1.dat   : Prior and posterior cases (accumualted)
dead_0.dat   dead_1.dat   : Prior and posterior susceptability (accumualted)
expos_0.dat  expos_1.dat  : Prior and posterior susceptability (current)
hosp_0.dat   hosp_1.dat   : Prior and posterior susceptability (current)
infec_0.dat  infec_1.dat  : Prior and posterior susceptability (current)

bigdump0.dat bigdump1.dat : A big dump of all model variables

obsD.dat                  : Death observations for plotting
obsH.dat                  : Hospitalization observations for plotting

par0.dat                  : Prior and posterior ensemble of parameters


PLOTTING:
~~~~~~~~
If you have tecplot (tec360) there are .lay and .mcr files in run.
Python/enkf_seir/plot contains both plot.py and a jupyter notebook for plotting
