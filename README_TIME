The model uses the following definitions for time:

"Startdate" e.g., 01/03-2020  denote that the model runs from 00:00am 01/03-2020, and this time is
set to t=0.0. (see the table below)

The system integreates the ensemble of models forward one day at the time, starting from 00:00 to
24:00 and thus outputs the solutions at midnight end of the day. Thus, the output files will
contain entries like 

 model time                                                         Output date
 0.00000E+00  Corresponds to 00:00 in the morning of the start day  (29/02-2020)
 0.10000E+01  Corresponds to 24:00 in the night of the start day    (01/03-2020)
 0.20000E+01  Corresponds to 24:00 in the night of day 2            (02/03-2020)
 0.30000E+01  Corresponds to 24:00 in the night of day 3            (03/03-2020) ***measurement time***  
 0.40000E+01  Corresponds to 24:00 in the night of day 4            (04/03-2020)
 0.50000E+01  Corresponds to 24:00 in the night of day 5            (05/03-2020)

"Intervention times":
If an intevention time is defined as 15/03-2020 the intervention is avtive (through values of R)
from the morning on the 15/03 at 00:00am, which corresponds to model time t>14.0.  This means that
R(t) switches from R1 to R2 from the morning of 15/03. Accordingly ir swiches from 1 to 2 for using
the correct Rmat(ir).

"Measurements"
A measurement for a particular day is located at midnight that day. Thus, given a measurement from
corona.in, e.g.,
 03/03-2020    7   154   2206
will be located at the same time as the output of day 3, i.e., the end of the day (see ***measurement
time*** above).
