The corona.in file contains 
"date"  "number of deaths" "Number of hospitalized" "Registred number of infected"
only the deaths and hospitalized columns are read and used in the conditioning.
A value of zero or negative means the measurement is ignored.

The output files are all in the run dir, in a Tecplot format (for my plotting software).
They can be plotted using plots.py or the notebook, both in python/enkf_seir/plot

I am normally plotting data from 
rens_1.dat  ensemble of estimated R(t)
case_1.dat  Number of cases
dead_1.dat  Number of dead
expos_1.dat Number of exposed
hosp_1.dat  Number of Hospitalized
infec_1.dat Number of infected
recov_1.dat Number of recovered
susc_1.dat  Number of susceptible                                      

The _1 means posterior _0 is prior 
and par0 and par1 contains prior and posterior ensembles of parameters.

The header of the files explains the content but it is normally
the "ensembler_ mean", " stdandard_dev" and all the ensemble members:
     "ave" "std" "  1" .....
If you delete the headers, any x y1 y2 ... plotting program would do the job.
